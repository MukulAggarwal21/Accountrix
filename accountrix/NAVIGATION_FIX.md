# Navigation Fix Documentation

## Problem Description
When users navigated from `/dashboard` or `/brandhiring` back to `/` (landing page), the URL would change but the component state wouldn't reset properly. This caused UI conflicts where the background color and CSS from the landing page would interfere with the authenticated user's interface.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Local component state management in the `Landing` component
2. No proper synchronization between URL changes and authentication state
3. Missing route protection that would redirect users appropriately

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Authentication Context
- Created `AuthContext` in `App.jsx` to manage authentication state globally
- Implemented `AuthProvider` component that wraps the entire application
- Added `useAuth` hook for easy access to authentication state

### 2. Route Protection
- Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component that checks authentication status
- Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to the landing page
- Prevents access to protected routes without proper authentication

### 3. State Synchronization
- Authentication state is now synchronized with localStorage
- Added event listeners for storage changes (handles logout from other tabs)
- Proper cleanup of authentication data on logout

### 4. Logout Functionality
- Added logout buttons to both Dashboard and BrandHiring components
- Centralized logout logic in the AuthContext
- Proper cleanup of all stored authentication data

## Key Changes Made

### App.jsx
- Added `AuthContext` and `AuthProvider`
- Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component
- Wrapped all routes with proper protection

### Landing.jsx
- Removed local state management
- Uses `useAuth` hook for authentication state
- Simplified component logic

### LandingMain.jsx
- Removed prop drilling for authentication state
- Uses `useAuth` hook for login functionality

### LoginRegister.jsx
- Updated to use `onLogin` prop from AuthContext
- Simplified authentication flow

### Dashboard.jsx & BrandHiring.jsx
- Added logout functionality
- Proper cleanup on logout

## Benefits
1. **No more UI conflicts** when navigating back to landing page
2. **Consistent authentication state** across the application
3. **Proper route protection** prevents unauthorized access
4. **Better user experience** with proper logout functionality
5. **Centralized state management** makes the code more maintainable

## Usage
The fix is automatically applied when you:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard` or `/brandhiring` as an authenticated user
2. Click the browser's back button or navigate back to `/`
3. The application will properly handle the state and show the correct UI

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Login as a recruiter and go to `/dashboard`
2. Click the browser's back button
3. You should be redirected to `/` with the proper landing page UI
4. Login as a student and go to `/brandhiring`
5. Click the browser's back button
6. You should be redirected to `/` with the proper landing page UI
